# Magical Expansion
An addon that lets you craft & use some magical charms

## What Is This Addon About
I used "HotbarPets" addon so long, and I quite like how it works.
But it had some limitations, so I wanted to create my version of "HotbarPets"

## How Do I Get Charms?
First you need to create 3 machines called:
***
 * **Cosmic Reformer**
 * **Heat Extractor**
 * **Void Manuplator**
***

After you craft these machines put them into their respective area.
Then you can use the outputs of the machines to create ```Elemental Core```.
After you craft it you need to use **Charm Infuser** to infuse core into special charms.
***
You can get more info from in-game guide.
